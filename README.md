### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## My name is Mike
# Welcome to my profile!

# When I'm not coding or cleaning a dataset, I'm passionate about lifting weights, reading, and spending outside.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on showcasing my SQL skills and how I interface them with Tableau.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I used to play in a jazz trio in highschool and college as an upright bassist.  The most memorable gig I ever played was for the Royal Jesters Society, an offshoot of the Freemasons. Truly an experience like no other.
