# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Mike. Welcome to my profile!

## When I'm not coding or cleaning a dataset, I'm passionate about lifting weights, reading, and spending time outside.

## Skilled In:
* Python
* SQL
* Excel
* Tableau | Power BI | Cognos Analytics

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on showcasing my SQL skills and illustrating them through Tableau visualizations.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I used to play in a jazz trio in highschool and college as an upright bassist.  One of the most memorable gig I ever played was for the Royal Jesters Society, an offshoot of the Freemasons! Truly an experience like no other.
